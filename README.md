Resource Measurement Facility for z/OS

## IBM RMF Performance Monitoring

The IBMÂ® RMF Performance Monitoring (RMF PM) is a tool that enables you to manage the performance of your z/OS host right from your workstation. By establishing a TCP/IP connection to one or more z/OS sysplexes, you can effortlessly access real-time data on the resources of the corresponding sysplex.

RMF PM offers great flexibility in creating unique scenarios to monitor the system's performance. You can easily sample data from different resources and combine it to comprehensively overview the system's performance. With RMF PM, you can visualize the performance data as bar charts to better understand the system's status.
